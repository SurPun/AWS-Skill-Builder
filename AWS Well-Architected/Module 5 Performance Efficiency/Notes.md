## Performance Efficiency

The areas of focus for Performance Efficiency pillar questions are:

    Selecting the right resource types for computing, storage, databases, and networking

    Reviewing your selection as AWS continues to innovate with new resource types and features

    Being aware of how your resources are performing through monitoring

    Making architectural trade-offs to maximize your performance efficiency.

An example of a Performance Efficiency best practice in compute, storage, database, and networking is selecting the appropriate resource types.

An example of a Performance Efficiency best practice in trade-off is positioning resources or cached data closer to end users.

## Key Points

- Use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements.

- Select appropriate resource types.

- Benchmark and load test.

- Monitor performance.

- Optimize location of resources, data, and processing.

## Summary

- Performance Efficiency is one of the five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It focuses on optimizing the performance of systems and applications to ensure they can handle the required workload efficiently and effectively. The features of the Performance Efficiency pillar include the ability to scale up or down quickly, minimize wastage of resources, and ensure optimal use of available resources. This pillar emphasizes the importance of performance monitoring and analysis to identify and resolve bottlenecks and improve overall performance.

The design principles of the Performance Efficiency pillar are designed to help organizations build systems that can handle variable workloads efficiently. Some of these principles include using automation to optimize resources, choosing the right instance types to match workload needs, designing for elasticity and scalability, and making use of serverless architectures where appropriate. Organizations should also prioritize the use of tools and technologies that support performance monitoring, such as CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray, to help identify and address performance issues quickly.

To achieve optimal performance efficiency, organizations should follow best practices such as setting appropriate performance targets, optimizing resource utilization, designing for failure and fault tolerance, optimizing data storage and retrieval, and monitoring and analyzing performance data regularly. Organizations should also establish performance baselines and benchmarks to help them measure and improve system performance over time. It is essential to regularly review and update performance metrics and targets to ensure that systems remain efficient and effective in handling evolving workloads. By following these best practices, organizations can ensure that their systems are optimized for performance efficiency, enabling them to handle increased workloads and deliver a better user experience.
