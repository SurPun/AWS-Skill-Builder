## Summary

Well-Architected review is a framework developed by AWS to help cloud architects build and maintain secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure. The review consists of five pillars, including operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization, and provides a set of best practices, guidelines, and questions to evaluate and improve the architecture's alignment with each pillar.

The intent of the Well-Architected review is to provide a systematic and comprehensive approach to assess and improve the design of cloud-based applications and infrastructure. By following the Well-Architected framework, architects can identify potential risks, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies in their architecture and apply the best practices to mitigate those issues. The review also aims to encourage a culture of continuous improvement and learning in the cloud community.

The benefits of the Well-Architected review include improving the reliability, security, performance, and efficiency of cloud-based applications and infrastructure, reducing operational costs, and optimizing resource utilization. By adopting the Well-Architected framework, organizations can also ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations, enhance their disaster recovery and business continuity plans, and accelerate innovation and time-to-market. Additionally, the Well-Architected review provides a structured way to share knowledge and best practices across teams, improving collaboration and communication within the organization.
