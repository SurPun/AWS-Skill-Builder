## Lesson 2 - AWS Cloud for Business

More companies are moving towards cloud environments because of the benefits it provides compared to traditional on-premises models.

The AWS Cloud environment offers speed, scale, innovation, and productivity benefits, which allows organizations to experiment with applications and new business models at lower cost and greater speed.

It also enables scaling of products to a broader set of customer segments, geographies, and channels.

Using the AWS Cloud frees up teams to innovate and use technologies such as advanced analytics, IoT, and automation at scale.

AWS is the most secure, extensive, and reliable cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally, enabling organizations to deploy their application workloads globally with a single click or build and deploy specific applications closer to their end-users with single-digit millisecond latency.
