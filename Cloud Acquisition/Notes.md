        Help them understand how cloud will affect their area.

        Understand how they will need to change and adapt internal skills and processes to maximize the benefits of the cloud.

## Procurement Foundations: Summary

Strategies for purchasing legacy technology will not work for cloud. That includes policies and structures in your organization. To get the benefits of cloud, you need to shift your thinking. Here are some key takeaways when it comes to procurement foundations.

When you buy cloud technologies, it is important that you understand what you are buying, that is:

CSPs can help you understand cloud acquisition best practices, and you should consider engaging them early to harness the full benefits of the cloud.
