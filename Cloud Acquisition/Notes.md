## Cloud Acquisition Fundamentals: Summary

Different aspects lead to and support cloud adoption. Even though procurement is central to your cloud journey, there are other important aspects that overlap and interlink with each other that contribute to this experience. Here are some key takeaways when it comes to cloud acquisition fundamentals.

    To ensure effective cloud acquisition, engage all stakeholders in your organization—not just your procurement lead—early and often.

    Work with each internal stakeholder to:

        Help them understand how cloud will affect their area.

        Understand how they will need to change and adapt internal skills and processes to maximize the benefits of the cloud.

- When you speak with your legal department about cloud procurement, what is a key consideration to ensure they have fit-for-purpose terms and conditions?

  Engage CSPs early to get the best fit and resolve differences.

## Procurement Foundations: Summary

Strategies for purchasing legacy technology will not work for cloud. That includes policies and structures in your organization. To get the benefits of cloud, you need to shift your thinking. Here are some key takeaways when it comes to procurement foundations.

When you buy cloud technologies, it is important that you understand what you are buying, that is:

    Direct from CSPs (cloud services)

    Indirect from Partners (labor to use cloud services or solutions built on CSP infrastructure)

CSPs can help you understand cloud acquisition best practices, and you should consider engaging them early to harness the full benefits of the cloud.

- CSPs are not responsible for requirements analysis and solution design.

## Key Aspects of Procurement

- What are the key areas of procurement that affect how cloud is bought? (Select THREE.)

  Pricing

  Security

  Terms and Conditions

We will highlight four key areas that affect how cloud is bought:

    - Pricing

    - Security

    - Governance

    - Terms abd Conditions

## Pricing

Use a pay-as-you-go model with on-demand, utility-like pricing

Have no upfront costs

Are not required to make a long-term financial commitment

## Security

Customer & AWS Responsibility...

## Data Sovereignty and Data Residency

## Sustainability

## Governance and Operationalization

## Terms and Conditions

## Key Aspects of Procurement: Summary

Six key areas affect how cloud is bought: pricing, security, data residency, sustainability, governance, and terms and conditions. If you don’t fully understand these areas, it can prevent you from getting the full benefits of the cloud.

Here are some takeaways when it comes to the key aspects of procurement:

    Cloud pricing is variable. It increases and decreases over time based on vendor pricing—it is not specific to customers.

    You should assess the security and resiliency of the AWS physical infrastructure by using third-party attestations rather than requiring that you audit and assess these elements. Using these existing resources prevents overly burdensome processes and duplication.

    It is important to understand data sovereignty and data residency early on to ensure that you can maximize the benefits of the AWS Cloud offering.

    Any analysis on the climate impact of a data center should consider resource usage and energy efficiency, in addition to power mix. Large-scale CSPs use a power mix that is 28 percent less carbon intense than the global average.

    You need to consider cloud governance in order to successfully operationalize your environment, which should be considered well in advance of a procurement. Because you maintain control over your data, as part of any acquisition strategy, you should assess the CSP’s capabilities to meet your cloud governance needs.

    Cloud terms and conditions are designed to reflect how a cloud services model functions (physical assets are not being purchased). CSPs operate at a massive one-to-many scale to offer standardized services and cannot customize services for individual customer requirements. It is therefore critical that you engage CSPs early to incorporate and use their terms to the fullest extent possible.
