   - Elasticity

## Aspects of AWS Cloud Economics

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) concepts:

    Operational expenses, or opex:

    Capital expenses, or capex

    Labor costs associated with on-premises operations

    Impact of software licensing costs

Opex: Day-to-day costs to your organization, such as services and items that get used up

Capex: Costs associated with creating the longer-term benefits

   - Server hardware costs

## Cloud Architecture Design Principles

Cloud architecture design principles:

    Design for failure.

    Decouple components vs. monolithic architecture.

    Implement elasticity in the cloud vs. on-premises.

    Think parallel.

- Design for failure: Understanding what and how components fail, and how to architect around failures to add resiliency
