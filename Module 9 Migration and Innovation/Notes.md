## Module 9 Introduction

Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

    Understand migration and innovation in the AWS Cloud.

    Summarize the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF).

    Summarize the six key factors of a cloud migration strategy.

    Describe the benefits of AWS data migration solutions, such as AWS
    Snowcone, AWS Snowball, and AWS Snowmobile.

    Summarize the broad scope of innovative solutions that AWS offers.

## Lesson 65 - AWS Cloud Adoptation Framework (AWS CAF)

AWS CAF perspectives:

    Business

    People

    Governance

    Platform

    Security

    Operations

AWS CAF Action Plan:

    Helps guide your organization for cloud migration

Knowledge check:

Which Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework helps you design, implement, and optimize your AWS infrastructure based on your business goals and perspectives?

    Platform Perspective.

    The Platform Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework also includes principles for implementing new solutions and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

        The Business Perspective helps you to move from a model that separates business and IT strategies into a business model that integrates IT strategy.

        The Operations Perspective focuses on operating and recovering IT workloads to meet the requirements of your business stakeholders.

        The People Perspective helps Human Resources (HR) employees prepare their teams for cloud adoption by updating organizational processes and staff skills to include cloud-based competencies.

## Lesson 66 - Migration Strategies

6 R's :

    Rehosting

    Replatforming

    Retire

    Retain

    Repurchasing

    Refactoring/re-architecting

Knowledge check :

    Which migration strategy involves moving to a different product?

    Repurchasing.

    Repurchasing involves replacing an existing application with a cloud-based version, such as software found in AWS Marketplace.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

        Refactoring involves changing how an application is architected and developed, typically by using cloud-native features.

        Retiring involves removing an application that is no longer used or that can be turned off.

        Replatforming involves selectively optimizing aspects of an application to achieve benefits in the cloud without changing the core architecture of the application. It is also known as “lift, tinker, and shift.”

## Lesson 67 - AWS Snow Family

The AWS Snow Family is a collection of physical devices that help to physically transport up to exabytes of data into and out of AWS.

AWS Snowcone

AWS Snowball Edge

AWS Snowmobile

Knowledge check :

What is the storage capacity of Snowball Edge Storage Optimized?

    80 TB.

    Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is a device that enables you to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. It provides 80 TB of usable HDD storage.

## Lesson 68 - Innovation with AWS

VMWare Cloud on AWS

Amazon SageMaker

Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I)

Amazon Lex

Amazon Textract

AWS DeepRacer

Internet of Things (IOT)

AWS Ground Station

Knowledge check :

    Which service enables you to quickly build, train, and deploy machine learning models?

    Amazon SageMaker.

    With Amazon SageMaker, you can quickly and easily begin working on machine learning projects. You do not need to follow the traditional process of manually bringing together separate tools and workflows.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

        Amazon Textract is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents.

        Amazon Lex is a service that enables you to build conversational interfaces using voice and text.

        AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18 scale race car that you can use to test reinforcement learning models.
