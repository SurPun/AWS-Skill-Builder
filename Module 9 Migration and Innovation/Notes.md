## Lesson 66 - Migration Strategies

6 R's :

    Rehosting

    Replatforming

    Retire

    Retain

    Repurchasing

    Refactoring/re-architecting

Knowledge check :

    Which migration strategy involves moving to a different product?

    Repurchasing.

    Repurchasing involves replacing an existing application with a cloud-based version, such as software found in AWS Marketplace.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

        Refactoring involves changing how an application is architected and developed, typically by using cloud-native features.

        Retiring involves removing an application that is no longer used or that can be turned off.

        Replatforming involves selectively optimizing aspects of an application to achieve benefits in the cloud without changing the core architecture of the application. It is also known as “lift, tinker, and shift.”
