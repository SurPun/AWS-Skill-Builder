## Lesson 15 - Module 3 Introduction

- AWS Global Infrastructure

  To understand the AWS global infrastructure, consider the coffee shop. If an event such as a parade, flood, or power outage impacts one location, customers can still get their coffee by visiting a different location only a few blocks away.

  This is similar to how the AWS global infrastructure works.

## Lesson 16 - AWS global infrastructure

- Selecting a Region

  - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
  - Proximity to your customers
  - Available services within a Region
  - Pricing

- Availability Zones

  -

- Knowledge check

  - Which statement best describes an Availability Zone?

    - The correct response option is A single data center or group of data centers within a Region.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

    A Region is a geographical area that contains AWS resources.
    An edge location is a data center that an AWS service uses to perform service-specific operations. Edge locations are examined in the next section of this module.
    AWS Outposts is a service that you can use to run AWS infrastructure, services, and tools in your own on-premises data center in a hybrid approach. AWS Outposts is explored later in this module.

## Lesson 17 - Edge Locations

- Content Delivery Network (CDN) - Amazon Cloudfront
- Amazon Route 53 - DNS
- AWS Outposts

- Regions are geographically isolated areas.
- Regions contain Availability Zones.
- Edge locations run Amazon CloudFront.
  - An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.
