## Module 10 Introduction

In this module, you will learn how to:

    Summarize the six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework.

    Explain the six benefits of cloud computing

AWS Well-Architected :

    Operational Excellence

    Security

    Reliability

    Performance Efficiency

    Cost Optimization

## Lesson 72 - The AWS Well-Architected Framework

Operational Excellence

Security

Reliability

Performance Efficiency

Cost Optimization

Sustainability

Knowledge check :

    Which pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework focuses on the ability of a workload to consistently and correctly perform its intended functions?

    Reliability.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

        The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to run workloads effectively, gain insights into their operations, and continuously improve supporting processes to deliver business value.

        The Performance Efficiency pillar focuses on using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

        The Security pillar includes protecting data, systems, and assets, and using cloud technologies to improve the security of your workloads.

## Lesson 73 - Benefits of the AWS Cloud

Takeaways :

    - AWS Services
    - AWS Terminology

    - 6 main benefits of using the AWS Cloud

        1. Trade fixed expense for variable expense.
            - On-premises data center costs
                - Physical space
                - Hardware
                - Staff for racking and stacking
                - Overhead for running data center
                - Fixed cost
            - Save money with AWS
                - Turn off unused instances
                - Delete old resources
                - Optimize your applications
                - Recieve recommendations from AWS Trusted Advisor

        2. Benefit from massive economics of sale
            - Achieve a lower variable cost than you could running a data center on your own

        3. Stop Guessing Capacity
            - Guessing your capacity upfront can be problematic if you over or under estimate.
            - Scaling on AWS
                - Provision resources you need for the now.
                - Scale up or down.
                - Scaling can take minutes, not weeks or months.

        4. Increase speed and agility
            - Experiment on AWS
                - Spin up test environments
                - Run experiments
                - Delete resources
                - Stop incurring costs

        5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
            - AWS allows you to focus on what makes your business valuable.

        6. Go global in minutes

Knowledge check :

    Which process is an example of benefiting from massive economies of scale?

    Receiving lower pay-as-you-go prices as the result of AWS customersâ€™ aggregated usage of services.

    Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale. The economies of scale translate into lower pay-as-you-go prices.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

        Deploying an application in multiple Regions around the world: This process is an example of Go global in minutes.

        Paying for compute time as you use it instead of investing upfront costs in data centers: This process is an example of Trade upfront expense for variable expense.

        Scaling your infrastructure capacity in and out to meet demand: This process is an example of Stop guessing capacity.
