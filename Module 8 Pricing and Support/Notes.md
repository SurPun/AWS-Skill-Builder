## Lesson 54 - AWS Free Tier

AWS Free Tier - Always free - 12 months free - Trails.

AWS Lambda allows for 1 million free invocations per month.

Amazon S3 is free for 12 months for up to 5 GB of standard storage.

Amazon lightsail offers 1 month trail of up to 750 hours of usage.

Knowledge check :

The AWS Free Tier includes offers that are available to new AWS customers for a certain period of time following their AWS sign-up date. What is the duration of this period?

    12 months.

    The AWS Free Tier consists of three types of offers that allow customers to use AWS services without incurring costs: Always free, 12 months free, and Trials.

    For 12 months after you first sign up for an AWS account, you can take advantage of offers in the 12 Months Free category. Examples of offers in this category include specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage, thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time, and amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out.

## Lesson 55 - AWS pricing concepts

Pay for what you use.

    For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing

Pay less when you reserve.

    Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.

    For example, suppose that your company is using Amazon EC2 instances for a workload that needs to run continuously. You might choose to run this workload on Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans, because the plan allows you to save up to 72% over the equivalent On-Demand Instance capacity.

Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more.

    Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

    For example, the more Amazon S3 storage space you use, the less you pay for it per GB.

## Lesson 56 - Billing dashboard

AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard

    - Compare your current month-to-date balance with the previous month, and get a forecast of the next month based on current usage.

    - View month-to-date spend by service.

    - View Free Tier usage by service.

    - Access Cost Explorer and create budgets.

    - Purchase and manage Savings Plans.

    - Publish AWS Cost and Usage Reports.

## Lesson 57 - Consolidated billing

Consolidated billing

    - Simplifies billing process
    - Share savings across accounts
    - Free feature

## Lesson 58 - AWS Budgets

In AWS Budgets, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

The information in AWS Budgets updates three times a day. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.

In AWS Budgets, you can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.

## Lesson 59 AWS Cost Explorer

AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that enables you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.
